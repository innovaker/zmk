## Environment Setup

There are 2 ways to setup the zmk development environment: Docker+VSCode and Native OS. The Docker+VSCode approach is a self-contained development environment while Native OS approach will setup your local operating system for development.

The Docker+VSCode approach is very straight forward to setup. The Native approach requires more up-front work but doesn't require installing Docker/VSCode and can be faster for development depending on your computer's hardware.

The links in the navigation bar will outline the necessary steps for setting up both of these approaches.

:::danger The Docker+VSCode environment will **NOT** run on arm CPUs. You must use the Native OS environment if using an arm CPU.

## ZMK Sources Setup

Once you've setup either the Docker+VSCode environment or Native OS environment you will need to setup the ZMK sources. Please see the [ZMK Sources](/docs/development/setup/zmk) section once you've setup your chosen environment.
